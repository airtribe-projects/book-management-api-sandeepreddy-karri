Add password hashing using bcrypt
Generate JWT tokens upon successful login
Create middleware to verify JWT tokens
Protect relevant book routes with JWT middleware
Test user registration, login, and protected routes

Step 4: MongoDB Integration
Install mongoose
Set up a MongoDB database (local or cloud-based)
Create a database connection file
Implement connection to MongoDB using Mongoose

Step 5: Refactor to Use MongoDB
Create a Mongoose schema for books
Refactor book CRUD operations to use MongoDB
Create a Mongoose schema for users
Refactor user registration and login to use MongoDB
Test all endpoints to ensure they work with the database

Step 6: Advanced Featuress
Implement pagination for GET /api/books
